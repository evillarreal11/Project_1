# Sleep Health vs. Occupation (Elisabeth Villarreal):

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset 

Occupation: The occupation or profession of the person.

Quality of Sleep (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the quality of sleep, ranging from 1 to 10.

Stress Level (scale: 1-10): A subjective rating of the stress level experienced by the person, ranging from 1 to 10.


# Test Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (H0): A personâ€™s occupation does not affect their sleep health.

Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): Sleep health is affected by occupations that are associated with higher stress levels.


# Visualizations:

- occupation_sleep_stress_corr.png


# Analysis:

Sleep quality and occupation stress have a negative correlation (r-value = -0.86). The higher the occupation stress, the lower the sleep quality.

The p-value is less than 0.05 (0.004). Therefore, sleep quality and occupation stress are statistically significant and we can reject the null hypothesis.
